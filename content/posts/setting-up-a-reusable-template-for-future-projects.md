When creating new .NET projects, do you constantly find yourself structuring them in the same way? Maybe you have found a certain project structure that suites your organization well. If you have, and you would would like to reuse this project structure, what you may need is a project template.

In this article I will describe how to create a project template and how to use this project template to quickly bootstrap a new project. With a project template, a future project can then leverage this template, reducing much of the boilerplate code needed to setup a project.
