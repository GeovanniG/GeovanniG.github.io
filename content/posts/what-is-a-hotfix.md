Software has bug and not all bugs are equal. Some bugs are mildly nuisances while others are critical and need to be resolved quickly. This is where a hotfix comes in.

A hotfix is a sudden release of a patch to address a known bug in production. It does not follow a normal release cycle of say a sprint, where we normally release on a set schedule. Instead, hotfixes are released as soon as a patch has been implemented and has been found to addresss the bug.

# Deploying a Hotfix Into Production

Hotfixes take many forms. For the most part, bugs of critical severity are normally discovered within days of a new release or when more users begin using a new site feature.
